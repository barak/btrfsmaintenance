btrfsmaintenance (0.4-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

    Btrfsmaintenance now ships systemd units, but they are not
    automatically enabled for this release.  Consult README.Debian for
    more information.  Please file a bug against this package to express
    your configuration preferences.  Additionally, I am interested in what
    all Debian users have to say about "Recommendations for balancing as
    part of regular maintenance"
    (https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg73292.html).  The goal
    is to ship a configuration that will satisfy the requirements of the
    majority of users in the first upload to unstable.

    All users will need to decide whether they want to use
    btrfsmaintenance-refresh-cron.sh or the new systemd units.  To use the
    new systemd units, take care to insure that all cron jobs involving
    btrfsmaintenance have been removed.
