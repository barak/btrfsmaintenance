btrfsmaintenance (0.5-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - /etc/default/btrfsmaintenance now optionally supports more granular
      systemd time and date specification.
    - balance, scrub, and trim are finally serialised as mutually exclusive
      operations.
  * Drop leading white space from NEWS.Debian, and rename the file as "NEWS".
  * README.Debian: Note that btrfsmaintenance is not yet aware of a system's
    power state (on AC, battery, UPS), plus minor edits for polish.
  * README.Debian: Add Qu Wenruo's position against balancing, with
    citation.
  * Switch to debhelper-compat 13.
